// This is a placeholder file for the TensorFlow Lite model
// In a real application, this would be a compiled .tflite model file
// 
// To use an actual TFLite model:
// 1. Train your model using TensorFlow
// 2. Convert it to TFLite format
// 3. Copy the .tflite file to this location
// 4. Update the code in the app to use this model
//
// For rabies detection, you would likely use a classification or object detection model
// trained on images of dogs with and without rabies symptoms
